Write a program that implements the Discrete Fourier Transform.  It should have functions that:
	-set the size N of the input signal (which will be a list of floats or pairs of floats (if complex numbers are desired)
	-compute the DFT matrix M using a primitive Nth root of 1, w=e^(2*PI*i/N).
	-compute sample input signals
	-set a user-defined input signal
	-compute the DFT of a signal (matrix multiplication)
	-display a graph of the input and output (show modulus (length) and argument (angle))
	-compute the character of the associated representation of the integers mod N:
		-normalize M to a matrix A by dividing by the determinant
		-compute the matrix powers A, A^2, A^3, ...
		-compute the trace (the sum of the diagonal entries) of these powers

The trace of the NxN DFT matrix is 1 + w + w^4 + w^9 +...+w^(N-1)(N-1), the sum of the first N square powers of a 
primitive Nth root of 1.  Compute the traces of the first N powers of the NxN DFT matrix for N=1,2,3...20, and 
plot them in the complex plane.
	-Is there a pattern?
	-Is the case of N prime special?
	-Read about Gauss sums on the internet.  Can you find a relation to your findings?

RSA
Write a program that implements the RSA public-key enryption and decryption scheme.  It should have functions that:
	-set the private key primes p and q and the public exponent a
	-compute the private exponent b
	-break up an ASCII string using small blocks (e.g., 256-bit or 512-bit numbers)
	-encode integers using the public key
	-decode integers using the private key
	-(optional) create keys using a prime-generation algorithm

Linear codes
Write a program that implements the error-correction scheme described in class.  It should have functions that:
	-set the coding function, the "generator" matrix (I,L) with n columns and m rows
	-encode m-bit words as n-bit words using the coding function
	-determine the number of bits of error in the transmission of a word using L that can be detected 
	-determine the number of bits of error in the transmission of a word using L that can be corrected
	-compute the parity matrix H
	-compute the syndromes of n-bit words
	-compute the coset decoding table (the list of error-correction vectors for the different cosets)
	-corrects a string of coded n-bit words to codewords (compute the syndrome, add the corresponding error vector)
