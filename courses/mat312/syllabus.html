Applied Algebra</br>
Summer 2012</br></br>

Instructor:</br>
Jimmy Mathews, jmath@math.sunysb.edu</br></br>

Office hours:</br>
Tuesday 2:00-4:00pm, Thursday 2:00-3:00pm in Math Learning Center</br></br>

Textbooks:</br>
We will closely follow some sections of</br>
-Humphreys and Prest. "Numbers, groups, and codes", 2nd edition</br>
-Duzhin and Chebotarevsky. "Transformation groups for beginners"</br>
These are available at the Math/Physics library (physics building level C, math building level 4), open 8:30am-7:00pm Monday through Thursday.  You are encouraged to go there and survey other texts, for example</br>
-Lauritzen. "Concrete Abstract Algebra"</br>
-Lidl. "Applied Abstract Algebra"</br>
-Durbin. "Modern Algebra"</br>
-Gallian. "Contemporary Abstract Algebra"</br>
-Weyl. "Symmetry"</br></br>

Homework:</br>
In addition to regular strongly recommended exercises, 10 homework problems will be assigned and collected.  Each will receive an integer grade from 0 to 1.  The total number of 1s out of 9 will become your homework grade.  A grade of 1 is intended for complete, clear, correct solutions.  The instructor agrees to return prospective homework solutions as quickly as possible, and you may resubmit corrections indefinitely.  If the assignment is a proof which appears in class or in a textbook, you may choose to use the "same" proof, but you should improve its clarity by rewriting it in your own voice.</br></br>

Grades:</br>
Your grade will first be computed as a number from 0 to 100 as a weighted average:</br>
-90% homework</br>
-10% final exam</br>
A standard correspondence will be used to compute the letter grade.</br></br>
