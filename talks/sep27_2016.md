Should you use computers (for mathematics)?
------------------------------------------- 

For many years I explicitly avoided learning how to use computers for mathematics calculations, experimentation, or research.

It is just incorrect to regard technology as a neutral means. [Technological instrumentalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_conception_of_technology) has been thoroughly debunked.

If you make computing technology convenient and available to yourself, or if you spend time learning how to interact with it, **it will change how you think** about your study and research.

**+** Computers can save you an enormous amount of time

**-** Computers can inhibit deep thinking

Overview of relevant computing domains
-----------------------------

- General purpose computing
    - Documents, presentation
        - TeX, Latex, BibTeX, ConTeXt, beamer, HTML
    - Organization, collaboration (text editors, browsers, blogging, networking)
        - e.g. ssh->lynx->MathSciNet
        - emacs, git, databases
    - Not just for office people; personal administration
- Numerics and statistics
    - Engineering, physical simulation
    - Probabilistic experimentation
    - e.g. MATLAB, or general purpose programming languages (C, Java, Python, Lisp)
    - many, many platforms
- Visualization
    - Low-dimensional algebraic and differential geometry, analysis
        - e.g. Mathematica, Maple, (Sage, Processing, ...CAD?)
    - Synthetic geometry
        - Geogebra ... 
- Computer algebra systems (slight misnomer)
    - Symbolic mathematics
    - Linear and polynomial algebra, rings, ideals
    - Arithmetic geometry
    - Combinatorics
    - e.g. Macaulay, Sage, Maple, LiE, Mathematica ...

Getting started
---------------

**Macaulay2**, **Sage**, and **LiE** are free and open-source software. Just download/compile. (Sage is even available for Windows).

**Mathematica** and **Maple** are proprietary. They are licensed to SBU for your personal use; Stony Brook "Softweb".

If you have an internet connection and a terminal emulator, you can access Mathematica, Maple, or Macaulay2 remotely on 
the math department servers:

```
$ ssh jmath@math.sunysb.edu
$ jmath@math.sunysb.edu's password:
...
$ /opt/mathematica10.3/wolfram
$ M2
$ maple
```

Features
-----------

### Mathematica

- Though the preferred usage is with the notebook-style graphical frontend, it has a powerful text-mode backend
- Big project. Well funded, documented, and maintained
- "Lingua franca" effect
- General purpose, no fixed paradigm: Numerical, Visualization, Symbolic
- "Intelligent" solvers, extensive implementation of calculus, special functions 
- Efficient, capable, and customizable 2d/3d visualization and animation
- Not *great* for tensor algebra or combinatorics

### Maple

- Only major competitor with Mathematica
- Graphical frontend less emphasized than in Mathematica, pretty good text-mode backend
- Also a big project, and well funded, documented, and maintained
- Also general purpose: Numerical, Visualization, Symbolic
- Some "intelligent" solvers
- Ok for tensor algebra or combinatorics
- My impression is that the ring-theoretic and differential systems support is better than Mathematica

### Macaulay2

- Very small group of official creators/maintainers (Daniel Grayson, Michael Stillman); lots of community extensions
- Mainly symbolic matrix and polynomial algebra, rings, ideals, algebraic geometry
- A real programming environment: Control structures, functions, and variables are intuitive

### Sage

- Becoming a serious competitor of the proprietary big two, Mathematica and Maple
- More extensible than the big two (more likely to have a wacky user-contributed library you want)
- Big project, well-funded (!), but free/open and mainly community-maintained
- General purpose: Visualization and symbolic computer algebra, linear algebra, group theory
- Like M2, a real programming environment (in fact, it is based on Python)

### LiE

- Small stable project, dating to 2000
- Special purpose: Representation theory combinatorics. Lie algebras, weights, roots, plethysms
- Mini-programming environment, with charming little Lie theory glossary (`learn ...`)

Examples
--------

### Geogebra

### Mathematica examples

Which smooth plane curves are conics?
```
EQ=a+b*x+c*f[x]+d*x^2+e*f[x]^2+k*x*f[x]
EQ1=D[EQ,x]
EQ2=D[EQ1,x]
EQ3=D[EQ2,x]
EQ4=D[EQ3,x]
EQ5=D[EQ4,x]
Eliminate[EQ1==0 && EQ2==0 && EQ3==0 && EQ4==0 && EQ5==0,{a,b,c,d,e}]
```
What's the outline of a torus?

Some animations:
- [Quadrics tangent to torus](http://www.math.stonybrook.edu/~jmath/pill.mp4)
- [Quadrics tangent to two spheres](http://www.math.stonybrook.edu/~jmath/cd.mp4)

### Macaulay2 example

Which matrices have a factorization [(orthogonal) x (anti-symmetric)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_matrix)?

### Processing (Java) example

What do the closed geodesics look like on surfaces of constant negative curvature?
Matt Genkin wrote a program this summer 2016 that shows you in the case of the 3-punctured sphere. [Its on GitHub](http://github.com/mgenkin/geodesics_on_pants).

### LiE example
